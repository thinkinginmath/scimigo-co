## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

1. **Schema Migration (CO-001)**
   - **Risk**: Data loss or downtime during migration
   - **Mitigation**: Test on staging, backup production data, rollback plan

2. **LLM Integration (CO-005)**
   - **Risk**: API rate limits, cost overruns, quality issues
   - **Mitigation**: Implement caching, set budget limits, human review required

3. **Real-time Streaming (CO-006)**
   - **Risk**: Connection stability, scaling issues
   - **Mitigation**: Fallback to polling, load testing, connection limits

### Dependencies

- **External Services**: OpenAI API, Redis, Problem Bank service
- **Team Coordination**: Content team for problem creation, Frontend team for UI
- **Infrastructure**: Database migration window, Redis deployment

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] All database operations complete without errors
- [ ] 48 Meta problems accessible via API (LeetCode-aligned curriculum)
